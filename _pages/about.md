## Research
### Banking on Resolution: Portfolio Effects of Bail-in vs. Bailout 
_Job market paper (CEMFI working paper Nr 2410)_ 
[[Draft](/files/Banking_resolution.pdf){: .btn--research2}]
<p> This paper investigates the impact of supervisory resolution tools-- bail-ins and bailouts-- on banks’ ex-ante portfolio choice and ex-post default probabilities in response to idiosyncratic and systematic shocks. Banks adjust their short-term and long-term risky investments based on anticipated resolution policies. I find that both types of shocks can create financial fragility, which the two resolution tools address distinctly. Creditor bailouts, acting like deposit insurance, eliminate the equilibrium with bank defaults. Bail-ins, on the other hand, lead to ex-ante portfolio composition adjustments: they reduce solvency risk under idiosyncratic risk but increase liquidity risk when both idiosyncratic and systematic risks are present, increasing the likelihood of systemic defaults. </p>

### The Effect of Bank Mergers on Lending and Risk-Taking
<p> This paper studies the trade-off between competition and financial stability generated by banking consolidation. I consider an economy with $n \geq 3$ banks where two of them merge for exogenous reasons. I assume that banks monitor borrowers, which lowers their probability of default, and that monitoring is costly and unobservable which creates a moral hazard problem. With insured deposits as the single source of funding, a merger generates higher loan rates, which in turn increases banks' margins and monitoring intensities. Thus, bank consolidation hurts competition, but increases financial stability. Introducing equity capital as an additional source of funding enhances monitoring incentives, due to a ``skin-in-the-game'' effect, which increases lending. This creates a trade-off that results in nontrivial changes in post-merger capital, loan rates, and risk-taking. If loan rates increase following the merger, both the merging bank and its competitors increase their leverage. Higher loan rates and higher leverage exert opposing effects on monitoring intensity and, consequently, on bank risk. Therefore, advocating banking consolidation as a means of achieving financial stability is no longer evident.</p>


### Banking Supervision and Bank Risk-Taking
joint with [Rafael Repullo](https://www.cemfi.es/~repullo/)
<p> This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effects of banking supervision on bank risk-taking. The model features a risk-neutral bank that raises one unit of insured deposits and invests them in a large portfolio of loans with a random return. The bank chooses the correlation in loan defaults, ranging from independent to perfectly correlated defaults. Meanwhile, the supervisor receives an imprecise signal regarding the proportion of loan defaults and intervenes by closing the bank early when the signal exceeds a threshold. The question is: will this combination of supervisory information and supervisory closure reduce risk-taking? The paper shows that a strict supervisor or a noisy signal reduces portfolio risk. Moreover, a supervisor aiming to close the bank when it is efficient to do so becomes more lenient when the signal noise increases.</p>
