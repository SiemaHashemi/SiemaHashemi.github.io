## Research
### Banking on Resolution: Portfolio Effects of Bail-in vs. Bailout 
_Job market paper (CEMFI working paper Nr 2410)_ 
[[Draft](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5036250){: .btn--research2}]
<p> This paper investigates the impact of supervisory resolution tools-- bail-ins and bailouts-- on banks’ ex-ante portfolio choice and ex-post default probabilities in response to idiosyncratic and systematic shocks. Banks adjust their short-term and long-term risky investments based on anticipated resolution policies. I find that both types of shocks can create financial fragility, which the two resolution tools address differently. Creditor bailouts, i.e., extending deposit insurance coverage, eliminate the equilibrium with bank defaults. On the other hand, bail-ins lead to ex-ante portfolio reallocation: they reduce idiosyncratic risk but increase liquidity risk when both shocks are present, increasing the likelihood of systemic defaults. </p>

### The Effect of Bank Mergers on Lending and Risk-Taking
<p> This paper studies the trade-off between competition and financial stability from banking consolidation. I consider an economy with $n \geq 3$ banks where two merge for exogenous reasons. I assume that banks monitor borrowers, lowering their probability of default and that monitoring is costly and unobservable, creating a moral hazard problem. With insured deposits as the single funding source, a merger generates higher loan rates, increasing banks' margins and monitoring intensities. Thus, bank consolidation hurts competition but increases financial stability. Introducing equity capital as an additional funding source enhances monitoring incentives due to a ``skin-in-the-game'' effect, which increases lending and creates a trade-off that results in nontrivial changes in post-merger capital, loan rates, and risk-taking. If loan rates increase following the merger, the merging bank and its competitors increase their leverage. Higher loan rates and leverage exert opposing effects on monitoring intensity and, consequently, on bank risk. Therefore, advocating banking consolidation to achieve financial stability is no longer evident. </p>

### Banking Supervision and Bank Risk-Taking
joint with [Rafael Repullo](https://www.cemfi.es/~repullo/)
<p> This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effects of banking supervision on bank risk-taking. The model features a risk-neutral bank that raises one unit of insured deposits and invests them in a large portfolio of loans with a random return. The bank chooses the correlation in loan defaults, ranging from independent to perfectly correlated defaults. Meanwhile, the supervisor receives an imprecise signal regarding the proportion of loan defaults and intervenes by closing the bank early when the signal exceeds a threshold. The question is: will this combination of supervisory information and supervisory closure reduce risk-taking? The paper shows that a strict supervisor or a noisy signal reduces portfolio risk. Moreover, a supervisor aiming to close the bank when it is efficient to do so becomes more lenient when the signal noise increases.</p>
